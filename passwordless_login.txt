remotepasswordless_login by adding user other than ec2-user without pem
==================================================================
step1:-connect to bastion server by using pem key(ec2-user)
(our scenario)-without pem we have to login.switch to root user
      -update vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config (:set nu,:65)
	  -enable PasswordAuthentication no to yes(:wq!)
	  -service sshd restart(check process by using ps -ef | grep sshd)
step2:-create a user(root only creats user. switch to root user by using sudo su)
      -useradd devopsadmin (useradd <username>)(to check weather the user is present or not by using (id <username>))
	  -passwd devopsadmin  (passwd <username> to create a password to user)
	  -exit and login to server by using normaluser(ssh devopsadmin@<public_ip>)
	  [devopsadmin@<public_ip> ~]$cd /tmp
	  -vi key.pem(bcoz normal user donot have permission to access pem file of system user(ec2-user))
	  -chmod 400 key.pem
step3:-now connect to another server(intranet) by using pem key
(our scenario)-without pem we have to login.switch to root user
	  -update vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
	  -enable PasswordAuthentication no to yes(:wq!)
	  -service sshd restart(check process by using ps -ef | grep sshd)
step4:-create a user(root only creats user. switch to root user by using sudo su)
      -useradd devopsadmin (useradd <username>)(to check weather the user is present or not by using (id <username>))
	  -passwd devopsadmin  (passwd <username> to create a password to user)
	  -exit and login to server by using normaluser(ssh devopsadmin@<private_ip>)
	  
our requirement is to login remote server without password	  
	
[devopsadmin@bastion ~]$ ssh-keygen   (donot give any input just press enter)
[       "            ~]$ ls -ltra
        "              $ cd .ssh/
		               $ ssh-copy-id devopsadmin@<private_ip> (remote server)
	  -enter remote server password
      -After,login to remote server,it won't ask password 
  key is added into 	.ssh/authorized_keys
